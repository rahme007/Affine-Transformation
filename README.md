# Affine-Transformation
This is a project that performs affine transformations such as rotations, and reflection. The problem is approached by a ladder image and projecting it on a walkway image. The images are converted into grayscale configuration to reduce the complexity of calculation of RGB image.
Then a ladder is projected into the walkway image.

The rotation yields a rotated ladder across the walkway. It can be seen from the figure 4, the ladder has been moved counterclockwise from its initial position. 45 degree rotation transformation is applied on the projected ladder

Reflection is also performed on the projected ladder and the behavior is observed in the same walkway
